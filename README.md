## About the Video Course
This video course delivers a focused exploration of the major architectural elements of Angular 2, and seeks to show viewers how to become confident working with these elements. It will be relatively low level in approach, and less visual in terms of manipulating front-end UI and events, and pure application development. This is as close as we get to the feel of a Cookbook in video form, and treats an array of different topics within Angular 2.. The value of this course is delivering an early exploration of the underlying mechanics behind Angular 2, and how to work with them effectively - this includes coverage of components, hierarchy of services and dependency injection, building custom directives, testing, in-depth routing and so on. An author-proposed idea, this course will land before the release of Angular 2, giving developers early guidance on how to work with the key aspects of Angular 2, whether thats using it for personal use, or applying this to developing applications for production.
